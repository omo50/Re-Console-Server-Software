RCSS is the version of Re-Console specifically meant to be ran on servers. It comes with more performance improvements then just running default Re-Console on a server, whilst being much more streamlined.

# üéØ Goals

### ‚öôÔ∏è Open Source
RCSS is comprised of only open-source or source-available mods, which gives you the ability to see the code and contribute to the mods in the pack. Without mod developers hard work, Re-Console, and by extension RCSS would not be possible. If you want to show the developers of these mods your appreciation, I encourage you to donate to them!

### üöÄ Performant
RCSS is built off the main reason this was made; server performance issues for servers not running the appropriate mods.
RCSS comes with the following performance improvements:
- Improved game logic performance
- Improved entity performance
- Improved memory and hardware usage
- Improved world generation speed
- Improved lighting engine performance

### üí° Features
RCSS does not come with any serverside utilities or content mods outside of Legacy4J and Nostalgic Tweaks.

### üì© Up to Date
RCSS updates very quickly to new MC and L4J versions.
